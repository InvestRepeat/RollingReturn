## Steps to use:
1. Download the Notebook (ipynb) and it can run on any IDE like Visual Studio that allows running python notebooks.
2. Download the index historical data (csv) from https://www.niftyindices.com/reports/historical-data
3. Put it in the same folder where the .ipynb file is.
4. Change the ```input_file_path``` and ```output_file_path``` in the .ipynb file accordingly with the name of the csv downloaded in point 2.
5. Run the file and it will automatically print the required values.
